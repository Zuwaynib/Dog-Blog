		<h2>Facts about Dogs</h2>
		<ul>
			<li><ins><strong>Their sense of smell is at least 40x better than ours</strong></ins></li>

			<p>The area of cells in the brain that detect different smells is around 40 times larger in dogs than humans. This means that  dogs can pick up on way more smells than we ever could. This is why dogs are often used to sniff out people, drugs and even money.</p><br>

			<li><ins><strong>Dogs can sniff and breathe at the same time</strong></ins></li>

			<p>Dogs rely a lot on their sense of smell to find food, potential dangers, and friends, so needless to say they sniff a lot. Their noses are designed so smells can stay in their nose while air can move in and out of their lungs at the same time, which means they can breathe freely and still work out what that smell is.</p>

			<li><ins><strong>Some dogs are fast and could even beat a Cheetah</strong></ins></li>

			<p>Most dogs could easily outrun a human – they’re built to run and chase! The fastest breed of dog by far, though, is the Greyhound. These speedy sight hounds can reach a top speed of 45mph within seconds of starting to run

			‘But how does this beat a cheetah?’ we hear you ask. Well, while a cheetah can get up to almost 70mph, they can only keep this going for around 30 seconds. Greyhounds, on the other hand, could easily run at speeds in excess of 35mph for seven miles. So despite the cheetah’s head start, they’d soon overtake.</p><br>

			<li><ins><strong>Dogs do not sweat like we do</strong></ins></li>

			<p>While dogs do sweat, don’t expect them to be getting damp armpits any time soon. Where humans sweat watery liquid to cool down, dogs produce a pheromone laden oily substance that us humans can’t detect (dogs know it’s there because of that great sense of smell). The only place that dogs sweat like us is on their paws, so instead they pant to cool down. This is why it’s so important to keep dogs cool on those warmer days to make it easier on them.</p><br>

			<li><ins><strong>Along with their noses, their hearing is super sensitive</strong></ins></li>

			<p>We all know dogs can hear much higher frequencies than us, but did you know they can also hear further? Generally, dogs can hear much softer sounds than we can, so they can hear things that are much further away.</p>

			<li><ins><strong>Dogs have 18 muscles controlling their ears</strong></ins></li>

			<p>If you have a dog, you might notice that their ears move around a lot. They actually have around 18 muscles responsible for moving their ears. These help them to change the direction of their ears slightly to hear noises around them better, and play a really big part in telling us how our dogs are feeling. A lot of a dog’s body language is expressed through what their ears are doing so a dog’s ears are vital in helping them communicate both with us and other dogs.</p><br>

			<li><ins><strong>Dogs are about as intelligent as a two year old</strong></ins></li>

			<p>Studies have shown that dogs can learn over 100 words and gestures, which puts their intelligence and understanding of us on a par with a two year old. However, dogs are much easier to train than a two year old! They’re used for all sorts of jobs, from military roles to assistance dogs, because they’re both clever and extremely loyal animals</p>
